# hello-world
Getting started and learning how to create notes in a new repository. A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.  Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
